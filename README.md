The regularly updated database contains more than 15,000 packages that will be added and available in the library forever after activation.

## FAQ
**Why it take so long to complete the script?**

The Steam API is limited to 50 package activations per hour.

Have a look into these [instructions](docs/instructions-for-users-with-many-packages.md) if you do already own many steam packages.
 
**Why not all available packages will be registered to you account?**

Some of packages like DLC, require to activate first base game first. Some can be not available on you region, or have other restrict.

**Can i be banned for use this script?**

No, this is Steam built-in feature. This script does not violate service terms of usage. Use this at your own risk, the author assumes no responsibility.

**What's the point of this?**

If some of this free packages will be removed or will be paid at future, you still be able to play them for free. A few games when installed give you +1 Games on your profile.

**How often does the package list get updated?**

The package list gets updated every hour via GitHub Actions. This does have the disadvantage that it costs me something (Proxy & Server provider) but I'll try to keep it up.

**How do I choose the steam accounts the script should use?**

The script will use on default all steam account which are connected to your ASF installation. It is possible to configure it in the `config.json` by changing the IPC â†’ account to the name of your accounts inside of ASF.

Default: `"accounts": ["ASF"]`

Example for configuration: `"accounts": ["Louis45", "Louis_45"]`
